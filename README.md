# EeveeSpotify

This tweak makes Spotify think that you have a Premium subscription, granting free listening, just like Spotilife.

## The History

Several months ago, Spotilife, the only tweak to get Spotify Premium, stopped working on new Spotify versions. I decompiled Spotilife, reverse-engineered Spotify, intercepted requests, etc., and created this tweak.

## Restrictions

Please refrain from opening issues about the following features, as they are server-sided and will **NEVER** work:

- Very High audio quality
- Native playlist downloading (you can download podcast episodes though)
- Jam (hosting a Spotify Jam requires Premium, joining by link currently works only with Jailbreak/TrollStore)

EeveeSpotify replaces Spotify monthly limited lyrics with Genius. If the tweak is unable to find a song or process the lyrics, you'll see the original Spotify one. **The lyrics might be wrong for some songs (e.g. random language translation, article, another song). This is due to how the tweak searches songs on Genius. While I've made it work in most cases, kindly refrain from opening issues about it. Genius lyrics are also not and will never be time-synced.**

In theory, implementing downloading/offline mode locally *should* be possible, but it will **not** be included in this tweak.

## How It Works

Upon login, Spotify fetches user data, including active subscription, and caches it in the `offline.bnk` file in the `/Library/Application Support/PersistentCache` directory. It uses its proprietary binary format to store data, incorporating a length byte before each value, among other conventions. Certain keys, such as `player-license`, `financial-product`, and `type`, determines the user abilities.

The tweak patches this file while initializing; Spotify loads it and assumes you have Premium. To be honest, it doesn't really patch due to challenges with dynamic length and varied bytes. Ideally, there should be a parser capable of deserializing and serializing such format. However, for now, the tweak simply extracts the username from the current `offline.bnk` file and inserts it into `premiumblank.bnk` (a file containing all premium values preset), replacing `offline.bnk`.

Tweak also changes query parameters `trackRows` and `video` in HTTP requests to true, so Spotify loads videos and not just track names at the artist page. Sorry if the code seems cringe; the main focus is on the concept. It can stop working just like Spotilife, but so far, it works on the latest Spotify 8.9.## (Spotilife also patches `offline.bnk`, but it changes obscure bytes that do nothing on new versions). Spotify may reload user data, and you'll be switched to the Free plan. When this happens, you'll see a popup with quick restart app and reset data actions.
